# pv-init

Bootstraps the `pv-*` framework in the current project: creates (or completes) `.claude/pv-context.json`, the single file that `pv-internal-workflow`, `pv-new`, `pv-fix`, `pv-how` and `pv-do` all depend on to work in any repo with nothing hardcoded.

**Language.** Use `framework.interaction.language` (default English) for everything you say to the user in this conversation, once it's known — see step 3 below for how it gets resolved on a first-time run. `.claude/pv-context.json` itself is configuration, not prose, so it stays as-is regardless of `language`.

Read [`schema.json`](schema.json) first if you haven't already this session — it's a JSON Schema that defines the exact shape of the file (the `framework` section), with every field documented in its `description` (required or not, what it's for, which skill uses it) and complete examples in `examples`.

**Before any other step**, read [`workflow.init.md`](workflow.init.md) — it's the source of truth for this flow's sequence and branches (see `pv-design.en.md`'s "Workflow diagrams" section for the notation). If it doesn't exist or can't be followed, stop and report that instead of improvising the flow from the prose below. The numbered steps that follow are each node's detail (which script to run, what text to use) — the diagram governs sequence and branching; if the two ever disagree, the diagram wins and this prose gets corrected to match.

## 0. Check the dev environment and required tooling

Before touching `.claude/pv-context.json`, verify that the command-line tools the `pv-*` framework depends on are installed and working. This step comes first because there's little point leaving the framework configured if `pv-new`/`pv-fix`/`pv-how`/`pv-do` then fail for lack of a tool.

Base tools, always needed (used by the framework itself, regardless of the project):

- **Git** — the repo is already a git repository, but check the CLI responds: `git --version`.
- **Python 3** — used by `pv-internal-workflow` (invoked by `pv-new`/`pv-fix`) to compute the sequential change code via [`../pv-internal-workflow/scripts/next-change-number.py`](../pv-internal-workflow/scripts/next-change-number.py). Check `python --version` or `python3 --version` (whichever alias resolves on this system).

Conditional tools — look at the repo (same as the exploration in step 2) to know which apply before asking anything:

- If there's a `package.json` → Node/npm: `node --version`, `npm --version`.
- Any other interpreter or CLI relevant to the detected project type — if it turns out to be a tool not already checked here, verify it on the spot before treating it as supported.

How to check: run the version commands with the shell tool for the system (`Bash` or `PowerShell` depending on the environment's `Platform`/`Shell`). A command that doesn't exist or returns a "not found" error counts as a missing tool.

Detail for this step's `ASK` nodes (`workflow.init.md`'s `S0Ask`/`S0Proceed`):

- Tell the user clearly what's missing and what the framework needs it for (use the list above as reference), and propose how to install it on their OS (e.g. `winget install`/`choco install` on Windows, `brew install` on macOS, `apt install` on Linux) — be specific about the package and the exact command proposed. **Never install anything without the user's explicit confirmation** — installing software affects the system outside the repo.
- After installing, re-check the tool (repeat the version command) to verify it installed and configured correctly (on `PATH`, expected version, etc.) before continuing.
- If the user doesn't want to or can't install something right now, don't assume which they'd prefer: ask explicitly whether to continue the initialization anyway (noting that part of the framework won't work until it's resolved) or stop here.

## 1. Check current state

The comparison against the fields in [`schema.json`](schema.json) is done deterministically and for free in tokens by the script [`scripts/check-context.py`](scripts/check-context.py) (standard Python, no external dependencies) — don't eyeball it against the schema yourself. Run from the repo root:

```
python .claude/skills/pv-init/scripts/check-context.py
```

It prints a single JSON on stdout: `{"exists", "hasFramework", "missingRequired", "complete", "hasLanguage"}`. `framework` itself carries `required: ["docs"]` in `schema.json`, and `docs` in turn requires `functional.featuresDocPathDir`, `tech.architectureDocDir` and `tech.styleBibleDocDir` — `check-context.py` reports any of those four missing in `missingRequired` (dotted paths). `workFolder`/`sourcecodeDir` still have defaults and are never in `missingRequired`. `complete` is `true` only when the `framework` section exists **and** `missingRequired` is empty. A non-empty `missingRequired` on an already-initialized project means a required field was lost (hand-edit, or a project from before the doc dirs became mandatory) — that's a **broken state, not a completion gap**: follow the `S1Broken` branch (invoke `pv-update`), don't try to fill it in via the `S1AskComplete` questionnaire. `hasLanguage` is `true` when `framework.interaction.language` exists in the file, regardless of its value — it's the only field whose absence unconditionally triggers the language question in step 3; `changes.language`/`versions.language`/`docs.functional.language` are optional refinements asked in the same round but don't gate `hasLanguage`. To know which genuinely-optional fields are still unconfigured (needed for `workflow.init.md`'s `S1Complete` branch), read `.claude/pv-context.json` yourself and compare it field by field against the optional `framework` properties in `schema.json` (`workFolder`, `sourcecodeDir`, `skillModels`, the `language` sub-fields — note `docs.tech` has no `language` field) to build your own "unconfigured optionals" list — the three doc dirs are **not** on that list, they're required.

Detail for this step's nodes:

- **`S1Broken` (invalid JSON, `check-context.py` fails to run, or `missingRequired` is non-empty on an already-initialized project)**: don't try to diagnose or fix it yourself — invoke `pv-update` (`Skill` tool) instead. It owns everything beyond "which optional fields were never configured": broken JSON, unknown fields, a required `docs.*` dir absent, referenced skills/paths that don't exist on disk, a stale `pv.py`, `skillModels` drift, etc. Once it finishes, re-run `check-context.py` and resume this step from the top. (On a **first-ever** init — `exists: false` — `missingRequired` listing the doc dirs is expected and normal, not `S1Broken`: step 3 will write them.)
- **`S1AskReset`**: use `AskUserQuestion` with this exact text:

  ```
  The `pv-*` framework is already initialized in this project. Do you want to reinitialize it from scratch? This erases the current configuration (`framework`) in `.claude/pv-context.json` and repeats all the questions as if it didn't exist.
  ```
- **`S1AskComplete`**: list the specific unconfigured optionals (including language if `hasLanguage` is `false`) and ask whether to complete/review them or leave things as they are; only if the user explicitly asks to reset everything from scratch, follow `S1AskReset` instead. If they want to complete things, step 3 is scoped to just those fields, and step 4 updates with a merge, same as fields missing outright. If `hasLanguage` is already `true`, never ask about language again.
- **Beyond `check-context.py`'s own checks**, if at any point in this step (or later, while exploring the repo or writing the file) you notice something it doesn't cover — a path configured in `pv-context.json` that doesn't exist on disk, `framework.skills.mockups`/`diagrams` naming a skill folder that isn't there, `{repo root}/pv.py` missing or clearly stale, a `{xxxx}` change code duplicated between `inProgress`/`implemented` — don't try to fix it inline: invoke `pv-update` (`Skill` tool) instead, same as `S1Broken`. Resume this flow afterward only if there's still configuration left for `pv-init` itself to handle.
- **Why step 5 always runs** regardless of which branch above was taken, including a run where the user declines every question and nothing in `.claude/pv-context.json` changes: this is what keeps `{repo root}/pv.py` current after installing a newer version of the framework's skill files — `scaffold-project.py` always overwrites `pv.py` unconditionally and only creates folders/placeholders that don't yet exist, so re-running it against an already-configured, unchanged project is safe and idempotent.

## 2. Explore the repo for clues

Before asking with a blank slate, look at the repo to propose reasonable defaults:

- Architecture/design document: a folder with `INDEX.md` under `docs/`, `design/` (current convention), or a loose `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`design_technical.md` (old convention, migratable).
- Features listing document: something under `docs/`, `design/`, or a `FEATURES.md`.
- Style guide (visual/interaction/writing): a folder with `INDEX.md` under `docs/`, `design/` (current convention), or a loose `STYLE_BIBLE.md` (old convention, migratable).
- Source code root folder: `src`, `app`, `lib`, or whichever carries the most weight in the repo.

## 3. Ask what's missing

Go through **all** the `framework` fields described in `schema.json`, section by section — none is assumed or left silently unresolved: required ones are always asked, optional ones are asked or explicitly confirmed (even if the most common answer is "use the default"), and only the pure fine-tuning ones (see below) may assume their default without asking. Use `AskUserQuestion` for any closed decision (confirming a detected path, choosing between options, yes/no); free text for open-ended things (project name/summary, desired style).

Fields to resolve — `framework` section:
- `workFolder`: always write the fixed default `"/previo-sdd"` silently, without asking or confirming it — same pattern as `skills.mockups`/`skills.diagrams` below, never mentioned in the questions nor in the step 6 summary. If the user ever wants a different `workFolder`, they change it themselves directly in `pv-context.json`, at their own risk — `pv-init` never offers or migrates towards an alternative. Inside `workFolder`, the `changes/`, `versions/` and `stuff/` subfolders always have fixed names — they're never asked about or configured; [`scripts/scaffold-project.py`](scripts/scaffold-project.py) (step 5) creates them right after the file is written.
- **Language** (new, always ask on a first-time init — see below for the partial-update case): first ask only the interaction language (`framework.interaction.language`) with `AskUserQuestion` — propose English as the default, making clear it can be any other language (free text, or an ISO 639-1 code like `es`, `fr`). Then ask, as a separate yes/no `AskUserQuestion`, whether they want that same language for everything else the framework writes, or want to set a different language per area. If they want the same for everything: set `changes.language`, `versions.language` and `docs.functional.language` to the interaction language and move on — don't ask the three questions below. If they want to configure areas individually, ask these three, in this order, each proposing the interaction language as its default and only diverging if the user says so:
  1. **Language of in-progress change/fix documents** (`framework.changes.language`) — language of the documents for a change/fix in progress (`description.md`, `plan.md`, `history.md`, and the sample text in `design_*.html`/`.txt` mockups) under `{workFolder}/changes/**`.
  2. **Language of the release changelog** (`framework.versions.language`) — language of `changelog.md`, generated by `pv-internal-changelog` under `{workFolder}/versions/{XXXX}/` from `changes/closed`.
  3. **Language of the feature documentation** (`framework.docs.functional.language`) — language of the feature listing (`featuresDocPathDir`) that `pv-do` keeps up to date after every implemented change/fix. Only ask if `docs.functional.featuresDocPathDir` is being configured in this same run.

  Technical documentation (`docs.tech`) has no language option — `architectureDocDir` and `styleBibleDocDir` are always technical English. Never ask about it.

  When you write or update `language`, also write (or complete) `framework._comments` with a short explanation of what each configured `language` field affects and why it was set that way — free text, one entry per field, ignored at runtime by every skill (same pattern as `skillModels._instructions`). Base each explanation on the field's description above (what it affects), plus the user's stated reason if they gave one.
- `docs.tech.architectureDocDir`, `docs.tech.styleBibleDocDir` and `docs.functional.featuresDocPathDir` (**required** in `schema.json` — `framework.docs` and both its sub-objects carry `required`). All three are always written and scaffolded, without exception. **Whether they're wanted is never asked** — never ask "do you want technical/style/features documentation?": that decision is already made, you only confirm paths and content. Not optional in any practical sense; the other skills refuse to run against a `pv-context.json` missing any of them and send the user to `/pv-update`.
  - Every one of the three is stored **relative to `workFolder`** (same as `changes/`/`versions/`/`stuff/` — the only path in `pv-context.json` relative to the repo root instead is `sourcecodeDir`), so it must physically live under `{workFolder}/`.
  - If the user **already has one as a folder** with `INDEX.md` (or you detected it in step 2) **and it's already under `workFolder`**, use that path as-is — don't regenerate it.
  - If the user **already has one as a folder** with `INDEX.md` but it lives **outside `workFolder`** (e.g. `docs/architecture` at the repo root while `workFolder` is `/previo-sdd`), offer to move it as-is into `{workFolder}/docs/...`, preserving its content — don't leave a duplicate copy outside `workFolder`.
  - If the user has one in the **old convention** (a single file, e.g. `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`STYLE_BIBLE.md`/`FEATURES.md`), offer to migrate it: create the folder under `{workFolder}/docs/` with an `INDEX.md` summarizing the file and a single content file (`01-contenido.md` or similar) with the rest, and delete the loose file.
  - If the user **is missing one of the three**, don't generate anything yourself here — leave its path (default or user-confirmed) written in `pv-context.json` as-is. [`scripts/scaffold-project.py`](scripts/scaffold-project.py) (step 5, run right after the file is written) creates the empty folder with its minimal placeholder deterministically, for free in tokens, instead of the model drafting it by hand on every init.
  - If the user says they don't want to **actively maintain** one of the three (e.g. no interest in a style guide), that's fine — but the field and its scaffolded folder stay. Keep the placeholder `INDEX.md` and leave the folder otherwise empty; the framework treats "folder with only its placeholder" as "nothing documented here yet", never as a problem. **Never delete the field or the folder** — every other skill requires all three configured, and a missing one is a broken state repaired by `pv-update`.
- `sourcecodeDir` (optional, default `"/src"`, but always ask/confirm it — don't assume it silently): propose the source code root folder detected in step 2 and ask for confirmation with `AskUserQuestion` (or the right name if detection failed). Write it with a leading `/` (e.g. `/src`, `/app`), relative to the repo root — the same convention as `workFolder`, to make it visually obvious it's not relative to `workFolder` like `docs.*` is. It's the root `pv-internal-tech-analysis` explores when the technical documentation doesn't answer what a change/fix analysis needs (e.g. `architectureDocDir` still holds only its placeholder).

  **Existing code check.** Once `sourcecodeDir` is confirmed, check whether that folder already exists and has content beyond an empty scaffold (e.g. more than just a `.gitkeep`) — a plain directory listing, no script needed.
  - **If it doesn't exist, or exists but is empty**: continue the normal flow below, without mentioning anything about analysis.
  - **If it already contains code** (an app already in progress): tell the user, with `AskUserQuestion`, using this exact fixed text — don't redraft or reword it, only translate it into `framework.interaction.language` (same rule as every other user-facing string in this skill; the source below is the English baseline):

    > Once all the configuration is done, I'll analyze the app in `{sourcecodeDir}` to write its technical and feature documentation. What level of documentation do you want me to generate?
    >
    > **(a) Minimal**: faster and with lower token consumption. Less accurate at first, but it fills in and improves automatically as new changes and fixes are added.
    >
    > **(b) Full**: slower and with higher token consumption (higher the larger/more complex the project). Better result from the start.

    This question only captures the user's choice. What each mode (option a = "minimal", option b = "full") actually generates in `architectureDocDir`/`styleBibleDocDir`/`featuresDocPathDir` is defined once, in step 5.5 below — don't restate it here.

    Keep the user's answer (minimal/full) in this conversation's memory only — never write it to `pv-context.json`, it's a one-off action for this run, not persistent configuration. This drives step 5.5 below.
- `numberWidth` (optional, default `5`, no need to ask unless the user wants something different): always write it to `pv-context.json` — the default value if the user doesn't want something else, same as `skills.mockups`/`skills.diagrams` below — never leave the field absent. The scripts that consume it (`next-change-number.py`, `get-max-change-codes.py`) have no fallback of their own and fail if it's missing.
- `skills.mockups` and `skills.diagrams`: always write their defaults (`pv-internal-mockups-html`, `pv-internal-tech-mermaid`) to the file silently, without asking about them or mentioning them anywhere in this init — not in the questions, not in the step 6 summary. If the user ever wants to swap the underlying skill/technology, they'll find that documented in `schema.json` themselves.

`skillModels` section (optional in the schema, but **always written** by `pv-init`, even on a run where the user changes nothing) — compute the baseline deterministically and for free in tokens with:

```
python .claude/skills/pv-init/scripts/collect-skill-models.py
```

It reads every `pv-*/SKILL.md`'s real `model`/`effort` frontmatter and returns the proposed `default` (the most common pair) plus `overrides` (one entry per skill whose frontmatter differs from that pair) — a straight mirror of what's already on disk, so `pv-context.json` never claims a baseline that doesn't match reality. Write that result as-is into `skillModels.default`/`skillModels.overrides`, and always mention it (even briefly) don't skip it silently: ask if the user wants to change anything upfront on top of that mirrored baseline (e.g. dropping another mechanical skill to Haiku, or raising some skill's effort). If they don't want to touch anything now, still write the mirrored baseline — never leave the section absent. If they configure something different from the mirrored baseline, remind the user in step 5 that they must run `python .claude/skills/pv-init/scripts/sync-skill-models.py` for the change to actually take effect on the `SKILL.md` files (this section alone isn't enough, see its `description` in `schema.json`) — a freshly mirrored baseline with no user changes is already in sync and doesn't need that run.

**Partial update case**: if `complete` was already `true` but `hasLanguage` was `false` (project initialized before language support existed), include the language question in the same round as any other unconfigured optionals — don't create a separate round for it. If `hasLanguage` is already `true`, don't ask about language again in this run.

## 4. Write the file

Create `.claude/` if it doesn't exist. Write (or update with a merge, without overwriting fields already present that the user didn't ask to change) `.claude/pv-context.json` matching the shape of [`schema.json`](schema.json) — same field names, no properties outside what the schema declares (`additionalProperties: false` at every level).

## 5. Scaffold the base structure and the `pv.py` launcher

Run [`scripts/scaffold-project.py`](scripts/scaffold-project.py) from the repo root:

```
python .claude/skills/pv-init/scripts/scaffold-project.py
```

It reads the `.claude/pv-context.json` just written in step 4 and deterministically creates, only where nothing already exists (never overwrites or touches existing content):

- `workFolder`'s fixed subfolders — `changes/{inProgress,implemented,todo,closed}`, `versions/`, `stuff/` — empty, with a `.gitkeep` so git tracks them.
- The folder + placeholder for whichever of `docs.tech.architectureDocDir`/`docs.tech.styleBibleDocDir`/`docs.functional.featuresDocPathDir` are configured. `docs.functional.featuresDocPathDir` follows a different convention from the other two (an `INDEX.md` regenerated via `pv-internal-doc-features`, never hand-written, and no `01-overview.md`) — the script already applies that difference on its own, nothing to decide here.
- `{architectureDocDir}/00-namespace.md` — the single per-project namespace tree seed (only for `architectureDocDir`, not `styleBibleDocDir`). Created only if absent; an already-present one is never overwritten. If the folder already existed but lacked the file, the script reports `status: "namespace_seeded"` for `architecture` instead of `"skipped"`.

It also copies [`assets/pv.py`](assets/pv.py) to `{repo root}/pv.py`, always overwriting whatever was there — it's a generated file, not user content, copied as-is without modifying a single line of it.

It prints a single JSON on stdout naming what it created and what it skipped because something already existed at that path — read it to know what to report in step 6, instead of inspecting the disk by hand.

For each of `docs.tech.architectureDocDir`/`docs.tech.styleBibleDocDir` the script just created (`status: "created"` in its output, not `"skipped"` or `"not_configured"`), **tell the user you generated it** (path and that it's a minimal placeholder) and **then** ask them in free text what they want to contribute to enrich its `01-overview.md` (what the project is about, technologies, desired style/visual references; if there are no style/palette clues either from the user or from step 2, fall back to the neutral black/white/grayscale palette already used as default). Edit that file yourself with their answer. If the user doesn't contribute anything, leave the generated minimal version as-is. `docs.functional.featuresDocPathDir` is never asked about this way — it's left for `pv-do` to fill in with each implemented change.

`pv.py` is a single self-contained Python file meant for anyone on the team to check or close framework changes directly from a terminal (`python3 pv.py`), without going through Claude Code or having to remember script names, paths or parameters: running it shows an interactive menu. Today it exposes `pv-status`'s read-only queries (general report, listing filtered by state, `todo/` ideas) and closing an implemented entry (moving its folder from `changes/implemented/` to `changes/closed/`, delegating to `pv-internal-workflow`'s `move-change.py` — an operation that only moves the folder, without touching any file's content, and which the menu explicitly confirms before running). This is the only place the skill expands if some other script turns out to be fit for direct exposure in the future: either plainly read-only, or mutations just as simple and already validated by their own script (like moving a folder) that are also explicitly confirmed before running. More complex mutations (deleting, creating versions, files with content to draft...) stay out of here, since they need context that only the corresponding skill can provide.

`pv.py` and the folders `scaffold-project.py` creates under `workFolder` (kept non-empty in git via their `.gitkeep`) are versioned in git like any other framework file (same as `.claude/pv-context.json`) — don't add them to `.gitignore`.

## 5.5 Analyze existing code and generate initial documentation

Only runs if step 3's `sourcecodeDir` check found existing code and the user picked a mode (minimal/full). If there was no existing code, skip this step entirely — don't mention it in step 6's summary either.

This step is the one that turns the three empty scaffolded placeholders into real documentation. It's easy to under-deliver here — invoke a sub-skill once, write a thin file, and move on — so treat the list below as a **checklist**: every box must be genuinely done before step 6, and step 6's summary must report the outcome of each. Don't mark a box done because the sub-skill was invoked; mark it done because the file on disk now holds what the box requires.

**Mode reminder.** The user's minimal/full choice (from step 3, kept in conversation memory) changes the *depth* of the architecture and feature content, nothing else. It never changes *which* boxes run: all of 5.5.1–5.5.7 run in both modes. The style bible (5.5.5) is drafted at full depth in both modes.

### 5.5.1 — Gather the code context (once)

- [ ] Invoke `pv-internal-tech-analysis` (Skill tool) with a summary along the lines of "initial full analysis of the app in `{sourcecodeDir}` to generate architecture, style and feature documentation for the first time", **and `bootstrap: true`**. That flag tells it not to resolve `docs.tech` via `resolve-path.py` (the folders exist but hold only their scaffolded placeholder `INDEX.md`, which would read as an empty/unsettled resolve) and to go straight to exploring the real code under `sourcecodeDir`, returning already-synthesized context (architecture/layers, style conventions, file/symbol map, interface/data-structure definitions, feature-relevant behavior). Only `pv-init` passes `bootstrap: true`.
- [ ] Keep this returned context in conversation memory — 5.5.3, 5.5.5 and 5.5.6 all draw from it, and it must not be re-gathered per box.

### 5.5.2 — Load the writing rules (once)

- [ ] Invoke `pv-internal-doc-technical` (Skill tool, no parameters) before drafting anything for `architectureDocDir` / `styleBibleDocDir`. Apply its returned writing rules verbatim to every file written in 5.5.3 and 5.5.5 — dense fact fragments, tables for parallel structure, `field: type = default` notation, fixed English tags (`[gotcha]`, `[motivación]`…), no narrative framing. These documents are read by AI in later `pv-how`/`pv-do` cycles, not by a human browsing the repo.
- [ ] For `architectureDocDir`, this same invocation also returns the **content-category checklist** (components and responsibilities, contracts and public interfaces, data flows, technical decisions and discarded alternatives, external dependencies, data model / persistence, configuration). Use it in 5.5.3 to decide what the architecture docs must cover — a category that genuinely doesn't apply to this project is simply omitted, never forced.

### 5.5.3 — Write `architectureDocDir`

- [ ] Draft the architecture documentation from 5.5.1's context, replacing the placeholder `01-overview.md` step 5 left there. Depth by mode:
  - **Minimal** — the main architectural decisions and invariants, plus a file/symbol map: one row per source file with its general responsibility. Not the full layer-by-layer / flow-by-flow treatment. Enough that a later `pv-how` knows *what each file does* and *what must not break*; it still falls back to the code for field-level contracts.
  - **Full** — the complete treatment: layers and their boundaries, data flows between components, every applicable content category from 5.5.2's checklist covered at field/contract level, technical decisions with their discarded alternatives, data model and persistence invariants, configuration and environment integration. Aim for the depth of a mature hand-written architecture doc, not a listing.
- [ ] Split the content across `{NNN}-{slug}.md` files by topic when it doesn't fit one file cleanly (same convention `pv-do` follows). Use `pv-internal-doc-files` for the file mechanics — `action=find` (folder=`architectureDocDir`) before writing each topic to check for an existing file, then `action=upsert` (folder=`architectureDocDir`, `area`, `title`, `body`, `existing_file` if `find` matched) so numbering and the `INDEX.md` table are kept consistent. Never hand-number files or hand-edit `INDEX.md`.
- [ ] Populate `{architectureDocDir}/00-namespace.md` (step 5 seeded it, or `scaffold-project.py` reported `status: "namespace_seeded"`): add the project's canonical name tree — one path per citable concept/assertion, `anchor: file#symbol` on nodes that map to code, `= value` / `:` + notation block on assertions, per `pv-internal-doc-technical`'s Namespace rules. Style concepts hang off the `ui.*` branch of this same file (5.5.5 adds them). Edit `00-namespace.md` with Read/Edit directly — never via `pv-internal-doc-files`'s `upsert` (the `00-` prefix is reserved infrastructure).
- [ ] Verify: `architectureDocDir` now has at least one `{NNN}-*.md` beyond the placeholder, its `INDEX.md` table lists every file written, and `00-namespace.md` is no longer just the seed.

### 5.5.4 — Decide whether the project has a presentation layer

- [ ] From 5.5.1's context, decide whether the project has a presentation layer — any UI an end user directly sees or operates: web, desktop, mobile, **or a CLI/terminal app** (its colored output, tables, spinners, progress bars and interactive prompts count). A project only lacks one if nothing it ships is ever directly seen or operated by an end user (a library, an internal backend service, a headless daemon). Record the yes/no — 5.5.5 needs it.

### 5.5.5 — Write `styleBibleDocDir`

- [ ] Invoke `pv-internal-doc-style` (Skill tool) with a summary ("initial style-bible generation from existing code"), 5.5.1's context (touched code, any `design_*` mockups if the repo has them, the presentation-layer yes/no from 5.5.4), and note there are no existing `styleBibleDocDir` files yet (only the placeholder). It returns which style categories apply (writing/naming always; visual design tokens, layout, interaction patterns, accessibility, reusable components, microcopy only with a presentation layer), what each must record, and the style-specific writing rules on top of 5.5.2's baseline.
- [ ] **If the project has a presentation layer:** draft the style bible at **full depth in both modes** — the complete catalog of every applicable category: design tokens with their actual values in tables, layout/composition rules, interaction states with their trigger conditions, accessibility facts (real figures/attributes/keys), reusable components, and the "what NOT to do" exceptions. Split across `{NNN}-{slug}.md` and manage files via `pv-internal-doc-files` (`find` / `upsert`, folder=`styleBibleDocDir`), same as 5.5.3. Add style concepts that become citable to the `ui.*` branch of `{architectureDocDir}/00-namespace.md` (Read/Edit directly).
- [ ] **If the project has no presentation layer:** `pv-internal-doc-style` will report only "writing / naming conventions" as applicable. Document that one category if there's anything real to record; otherwise leave the folder at just its placeholder `INDEX.md` and state in step 6's summary that the style bible legitimately stays empty (no presentation layer). Never force empty content and never delete the folder or the field.
- [ ] Verify: either `styleBibleDocDir` has real `{NNN}-*.md` content with its `INDEX.md` updated, or the "no presentation layer" outcome is recorded for step 6.

### 5.5.6 — Write the feature listing (`featuresDocPathDir`)

- [ ] Build the app's complete feature list from 5.5.1's context — one entry per user-facing capability, grouped by functional area. This must be **exhaustive**: every feature the app exposes, not a sample. Cross-check against the file/symbol map from 5.5.3 so nothing user-facing is missed.
- [ ] For **each** feature in that list, invoke `pv-internal-doc-features`: `action=find` first (normally no match — this is the first pass), then `action=upsert` with `area`, `title`, `body`, `available_in`, and `codes` (use the neutral reference `init` — there's no real change/fix `xxxx` here), plus `existing_file` if `find` matched. Depth of `body` by mode:
  - **Minimal** — name + functional area + one or two sentences of what the feature lets the user do. No extended walkthrough.
  - **Full** — the complete functional description per feature: behavior, states, where it's used, edge cases the user would notice.
- [ ] Don't stop after a few — iterate the whole list. `pv-internal-doc-features` owns numbering and `INDEX.md`; each `upsert` regenerates the index.
- [ ] Verify: `featuresDocPathDir` (folder case) has one `{NNN}-*.md` per feature on the list, and its `INDEX.md` lists them all. (Single-file legacy case: one entry per feature in the file, under its area heading.)

### 5.5.7 — Report the outcome

- [ ] In step 6's summary (not a separate report), state for each of the three doc dirs: how many files were generated, at which depth (minimal/full), and — for the style bible — whether it was populated or intentionally left empty for lack of a presentation layer. Also confirm `00-namespace.md` was populated. If any box in 5.5.3 / 5.5.5 / 5.5.6 could not be completed, say which and why rather than leaving it silently half-done.

## 6. Verify and confirm

Before considering the initialization done:

1. Run `python .claude/skills/pv-init/scripts/check-context.py` again on the freshly written file and check it returns `"complete": true` (and `"hasLanguage": true` if language was configured in this run). If not, something was written wrong (e.g. the `framework` section ended up empty or was never written) — fix it before continuing, don't assume it's fine without checking.
2. Check step 5's `scaffold-project.py` output: every folder it reports as `"created"` or `"skipped"` should be configured and real on disk — a `docs.*` field with no matching entry in that JSON means it wasn't picked up correctly. If any of the three was left undefined because the user explicitly declined it, confirm no trace was left on disk or in the JSON (see step 5's decline handling).
3. Confirm `{repo root}/pv.py` exists and matches [`assets/pv.py`](assets/pv.py) (step 5's `pvPy.status` should read `"overwritten"`).

Show the user a complete summary of what was configured: the file's path, every `framework` field resolved (including ones left unconfigured and why), the resolved language configuration (`interaction.language`/`changes.language`/`versions.language`/`docs.functional.language` — `docs.tech` has no language option, it's always technical English — and what was written to `framework._comments`), the `skillModels` baseline written (`default`, and `overrides` if any skill differs from it — always written now, even with no customization), with the reminder to run `sync-skill-models.py` only if the user changed something beyond the mirrored baseline, and that they can now run `python3 pv.py` from the repo root to check the framework's status without going through Claude Code. If step 5.5 ran, include in this same summary everything its box 5.5.7 requires: for each of `architectureDocDir`/`styleBibleDocDir`/`featuresDocPathDir`, how many files were generated and at which level (minimal/full), whether `00-namespace.md` was populated, whether the style bible was populated or intentionally left empty (no presentation layer), and any 5.5 box that could not be completed and why. Remind the user they can invoke this skill again to reconfigure any field later.
