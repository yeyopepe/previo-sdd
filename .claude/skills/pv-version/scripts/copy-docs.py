"""Zips and copies the current documentation into a release (pv-version skill).

Zips each of the paths configured in .claude/pv-context.json's
framework.docs.tech.architectureDocDir, framework.docs.tech.styleBibleDocDir
and framework.docs.functional.featuresDocPathDir, and saves each .zip at
{workFolder}/versions/{xxxx}/docs/. Each path can be a folder (zipped whole,
including its INDEX.md if it has one) or a single .md file (a valid case for
featuresDocPathDir in projects that haven't migrated to a folder) -- in both
cases the resulting .zip is named after the path's base name (folder or file
without extension) + ".zip".

All three doc dirs are required fields (pv-init always configures and
scaffolds them; schema.json marks them required), so none should be missing.
If one is absent from pv-context.json, or points at a path that doesn't
exist, this script exits non-zero -- a broken config that pv-update should
have fixed, not a case to silently skip. A folder that exists but holds only
its placeholder INDEX.md is fine and gets zipped as-is.

This resolves the docs.* dirs itself (docs.* -> workFolder, sourcecodeDir ->
repo root) rather than calling pv-init/scripts/resolve-path.py: it's a fully
deterministic script that never "guesses" a path, so the original motivation
for that helper (skills modelling a resolution rule from prose) doesn't
apply. The resolution rule here still has to match resolve-path.py and
pv-update/scripts/audit-context.py's check_docs_dir -- change all three
together.

Prints ONLY a JSON on stdout with what was copied, for the skill to use when
confirming to the user:

  {"copied": ["docs/architecture", "docs/style", "docs/features"]}

Usage:
  python copy-docs.py --xxxx 00001
