# dev-changelog

Generates `.claude/pv-changelog.en.md` and `.claude/pv-changelog.es.md`: a changelog of the `pv-*` framework as it's actually distributed to projects — `.claude/skills/pv-*/**` and `.claude/pv-doc/pv-guide*` only. Nothing else in the repo (dev-only skills like `dev-onescript`, `pv-doc` design docs other than `pv-guide*`, tests, this very skill) is in scope: those aren't shipped to consuming projects, so they don't belong in a changelog aimed at the framework's users.

`.claude/pv-changelog.en.md`/`.es.md` are themselves distributed content — `install.sh`/`install.ps1` copy both into consuming projects alongside `pv-guide*`, the same way `pv-internal-changelog`'s output isn't. Always write both language versions, English and Spanish, as exact translations of each other — independent of `interaction.language`: the changelog documents the framework's own releases for whoever maintains/updates an installation, regardless of which language they read it in.

## 1. Resolve the current version (`XXX`)

Read the `metadata.version` frontmatter field from every `.claude/skills/pv-*/SKILL.md` (all of them, including `pv-internal-*`). They're expected to share a single version across the whole framework.

- If they all agree, that value is `XXX`. **Still confirm it explicitly with the user** before continuing ("current version is `{value}`, correct?") — don't assume silence means yes, wait for their reply.
- If they disagree, tell the user which skills report which versions and ask them directly which one is `XXX` — don't guess or take a majority vote.

## 2. Resolve the previous version (`YYY`) and the base ref

Always ask the user — never infer it from `git log`, tags, or file history. Two things are needed and both must come from the user:

- **`YYY`**: the previous version number to show in the title.
- **The base ref**: the git ref to diff from — a commit hash, a tag (e.g. comparing the current state against a specific released tag), or a branch. If the user invoked this skill with an argument (`argument-hint`), treat it as the proposed base ref and still confirm `YYY` with them; otherwise ask for both together. Whatever form the user gives it in (a raw hash, "the first commit of this branch", "tag v0.9.2", "compare against main"), resolve it to a concrete ref before step 3 — e.g. `git log --oneline main..HEAD | tail -1` for "first commit of this branch", or `git tag --list` if the user names a tag you need to locate.

Don't proceed past this step without an explicit answer for both.

## 3. Diff the distributed content only

Run from the repo root:

```
git diff --stat <base-ref>..HEAD -- .claude/skills/pv-* .claude/pv-doc/pv-guide*
```

to get an overview, then the full diff for content analysis:

```
git diff <base-ref>..HEAD -- .claude/skills/pv-* .claude/pv-doc/pv-guide*
```

If the diff is empty, tell the user nothing changed in the distributed framework content between `<base-ref>` and `HEAD` and stop here — don't write an empty changelog file.

Also check for renames/deletions explicitly, since `git diff` can obscure a whole-skill removal among many line-level hunks:

```
git diff --summary <base-ref>..HEAD -- .claude/skills/pv-* .claude/pv-doc/pv-guide*
```

## 4. Classify by reading the actual diff content

Base every entry on what the diff shows — not on commit messages (commit history for this range may be unrelated squashes or WIP messages and isn't a reliable functional description). For each distinct piece of functionality that changed (typically one skill, or one clearly separable capability within a skill):

- **New** — a new `pv-*` skill directory appears, or a new capability/step is added inside an existing skill that didn't exist at the base ref.
- **Changed** — an existing skill's behavior, flow, or documented capability is modified (including `pv-guide*` content describing existing functionality differently).
- **Deleted** — a `pv-*` skill directory is removed, or a capability/step present at the base ref is removed.

**Informational focus: functional changes only, by default.** Write from a functional perspective (what the framework now does differently for someone using/interacting with it), not a technical one — no file paths, function names, script internals, or line-level detail. One or two sentences per entry, changelog tone, past tense.

**Stay at the main-concept level, not the fine detail.** If a skill's `SKILL.md` changed, describe the overall capability/flow that changed, not step-by-step wording tweaks, exact thresholds/numbers, or internal field names. If a change was implemented in a script, describe the general functional effect (what the framework now does differently for the user), not the implementation detail (parsing logic, internal function/field names, exact regex or data shape). Before finalizing an entry, ask "would a consumer of this framework care about this exact detail, or just that this capability/behavior changed?" — keep only the latter.

**Exception — technical/structural changes that need user action.** Only include a technical-level entry when the diff shows one of these, since consuming projects need to act on it when updating:

- An **architecture** change to how the framework itself is built or wired (e.g. a skill's invocation contract changes, a new required config field appears in `pv-context.json`'s schema, an internal skill's calling convention changes).
- A **folder structure** change in what the framework distributes (e.g. `workFolder`'s expected subfolder layout changes, a skill moves/is renamed, `pv-guide*`'s own location changes).

For these, state plainly what changed structurally and what action the user must take when updating (e.g. "re-run `pv-update`", "move `X` to `Y` manually"). Skip this exception entirely if nothing in the diff rises to this level — most changes won't, and the changelog should stay functional by default. Don't invoke `pv-internal-changelog` or read `{workFolder}/changes/`; this skill's classification is independent, based only on the real git diff from step 3.

**Each entry needs a title describing the change itself, not the skill that contains it.** The bold lead-in of every bullet (see the template) must be a short title summarizing *what changed*, e.g. "Working folder is no longer configurable" or "Trivial-fix risk threshold relaxed" — not the skill's name (`pv-init`, `pv-fix`...) used as if it were the title. Name the skill(s) involved in the summary sentence that follows, in backticks, not in the title itself. If a single skill has two clearly separable changes, give each its own entry with its own title rather than combining them under one.

**Group entries by theme within each section.** Once every entry for a section (New/Changed/Deleted) is drafted, look for entries that share the same underlying topic (e.g. several entries all about documentation generation, several all about risk assessment, several all about a specific skill's workflow) and group them under a theme instead of leaving them as a flat list. In the detail section, a theme is a bold, unlinked bullet naming the topic followed by a colon, prefixed with 📂 to mark it as a group (`- 📂**{Theme}**:`), with its member entries nested as indented sub-bullets directly beneath it — not a heading, since it doesn't need its own anchor. A theme needs at least two entries to justify grouping — a single entry, even if loosely related to a theme, stays ungrouped, listed as a normal top-level bullet with no theme line of its own, rather than being forced into a nearby group it doesn't squarely belong to. Double-check each grouped entry actually belongs to its theme (same specific topic, not just the same skill or vaguely related area) before finalizing — a misplaced entry is worse than an ungrouped one. Order themes and any ungrouped entries by whichever reads most naturally (e.g. most impactful first); this doesn't need to match arrival order in the diff. Skip grouping entirely for a section with too few entries overall (roughly three or fewer) or where no real thematic overlap exists — don't force groups where entries are unrelated.

## 5. Write the files

Draft the entries in whichever language comes naturally while classifying the diff in step 4. Write `.claude/pv-changelog.en.md` following [`dev-changelog.template.md`](dev-changelog.template.md) **exactly** — title line, heading text, emoji, and the Index-before-detail structure all come from that template verbatim; don't reproduce or paraphrase its literal formatting here, since the template is the single source of truth and this file must never drift out of sync with it. Fill in `{XXX}`/`{YYY}` and every entry (Index titles matching the detail titles, grouped and ordered the same way New/Changed/Deleted).

Carry any thematic grouping from step 4 into the detail section as described above (`- 📂**{Theme}**:` bullet with nested children). **In the Index, a theme collapses to a single plain (non-bold) line, still prefixed with 📂 — the icon, then the theme name, then its entry count in parentheses, e.g. `📂Theme name (3 changes)` — with its member entries not listed at all.** Don't bold the theme name in the Index and don't link it to anything (only the 📂 icon is shared with the detail section's formatting). An ungrouped (ordinary) entry keeps its own plain top-level Index line as before (just its title, no icon, no count). So a section mixing grouped and ungrouped entries produces an Index with some plain title-only lines (ungrouped entries) and some plain `📂Name (N changes)` lines (one per theme, count matching its nested-entry total in the detail section), never a nested sub-list under a theme in the Index.

**Keep the emoji glued directly to section heading text with no space** (`## ⭐New`, not `## ⭐ New`) — a space between them breaks the anchor link, since GitHub's anchor for a heading is derived from the heading text with the emoji stripped and everything lowercased, and a leftover leading space would shift the anchor. The template's index links are placeholders (`#link-to-new-section` etc.), not literal text to copy — after writing each `## {emoji}{heading}` line (no space), replace the placeholder with that heading's real anchor: strip the emoji, lowercase the remaining heading text, and use that (e.g. a heading `## ⭐New` anchors as `#new`). Omit an entire section (in both the index and the detail) if it has no entries — don't leave the heading with nothing under it. If the file already exists, overwrite it (this skill always regenerates the full comparison from scratch, it doesn't append).

Then produce `.claude/pv-changelog.es.md` as its exact Spanish translation — same structure (including the template's emoji, glued to the heading text with no space), same entries, same order, only the prose and heading text translated. **Anchors are language-specific, not copied from the English file**: each file's index links must point to that same file's own translated headings (e.g. `## ✏️Cambios` anchors as `#cambios`, not `#changed`) — recompute them for the translated headings using the same rule as above. Don't translate the prose yourself: invoke the `es-translate` skill (Skill tool) with the finished English file's content (changelog/release-notes register) and write its result to `.claude/pv-changelog.es.md`, then fix up the headings (no space after the emoji) and index anchors per the rules above (the translator skill isn't told about GitHub's anchor-slug rules, so verify/correct them after — translation can reintroduce the space or leave a stale English anchor). If you drafted the entries in Spanish first instead, write that draft to `.claude/pv-changelog.es.md` (still following the template's exact formatting, emoji spacing and anchors included) and invoke `en-translate` the same way to produce `.claude/pv-changelog.en.md`, then likewise fix up its headings and anchors. Either direction, only one of the two files is hand-written — the other is always the translator skill's output (plus the heading/anchor fix-up), never redone by hand, so the two never drift out of sync.

## 6. Confirm to the user

State both paths written (`.claude/pv-changelog.en.md` and `.claude/pv-changelog.es.md`), the base ref used, and how many entries landed in each section (New/Changed/Deleted).
